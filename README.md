# leaving-x
A script to publish a Twitter archive to Bluesky.


## Introduction

As a developer, I am no longer interested in working with the Twitter/X API. That's saying a lot from someone who was on the Twitter developer relations team for 8 years (and built with Twitter data for 10). 

There are plenty of reason to move from X, including the pay-to-verify joke, the removal of the trust-and-safety team, and the recent change in Block behavior. As a developer, the $100/month for hobbyist levels of data access is laughable. 

So, this project started as an exercise to start learning the Bluesky API and the underlying AT Protocol. From the start, I loved the underlying concepts and design for a distributing network. A place where the entire ecosystem can not be bought by someone who wants to take it in a direction you do not support. 

For me, the last step for deleting my account was somehow saving the decade of content that I had sometimes curated with intention. Hundreds of fun photographs, screenshots, travel notes, and professional updates. 

So if you want to port your Twitter archive to somewhere else, I highly encourage that. This is not a novel idea, and there are great tools out there to help you do that. Including some that provides this service as a Chrome extension. 

If you are a Python developer, and want to manage the process yourself, you are in the right place ;) 



## Setting up the `.env.local` file

Before running the script, youâ€™ll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project. This file contains environment variables necessary for Bluesky API authentication and Twitter archive configuration settings. Follow these steps:

### Copy the example file to create a new .env.local file
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Update the `.env.local` file with your specific settings:


```bash
# Bluesky API authentication details
BLUESKY_PDS_URL = 'https://bsky.social'
BLUESKY_HANDLE = '{your_handle}.bsky.social'  # Replace `{your_handle}` with your actual Bluesky handle
BLUESKY_PASSWORD = 'your_password'            # Replace `your_password` with your Bluesky password

# Directory for Twitter data (ensure `tweets.js` and `tweets_media` folder are here)
TWITTER_DATA_ROOT_FOLDER = './twitter_data'

# Script configuration
SLEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 60  # Adjust interval between posts (in seconds)
```

After setting up your `.env.local` file with these values, the script will be able to read the environment variables needed for authentication and data handling.

Requirements
Python 3.8+
Libraries: tweet_archive_parser, bluesky_poster, aiohttp, asyncio, python-dotenv
A valid .env.local file with credentials for both Twitter and Bluesky
Setup
Clone this repository.
Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the .env.local file in the same directory as the script with the following environment variables:
makefile
Copy code
BLUESKY_HANDLE=<your_bluesky_handle>
BLUESKY_PASSWORD=<your_bluesky_password>
BLUESKY_PDS_URL=<your_bluesky_pds_url>
TWITTER_DATA_ROOT_FOLDER=<path_to_your_twitter_data_folder>
SLEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS=<desired_delay_in_seconds_between_posts>
Configuration
Make sure the TWITTER_DATA_ROOT_FOLDER points to the root folder of your downloaded Twitter archive, which should include:

tweets.js: Contains the tweet data.
tweets_media: Directory with images associated with the tweets.
Usage
To run the script: python script_name.py

The script will:

Load the last processed tweet's timestamp from last_processed_timestamp.txt.
Parse the Twitter archive to load tweets created after the last processed timestamp.
Filter out replies and extract metadata for posting.
Post each tweet to Bluesky, introducing a delay to avoid rate limits.
Update last_processed_timestamp.txt to track progress.
Details
Files Used
tweets.js: A file containing tweet data from the Twitter archive.
tweets_media/: Folder with media files (images) associated with the tweets.
last_processed_timestamp.txt: Stores the timestamp of the last successfully posted tweet to continue from that point on the next run.
Main Functions
load_last_processed_timestamp(): Loads the last posted tweet's timestamp.
save_last_processed_timestamp(timestamp): Saves the timestamp of the most recent post to file.
create_post(config, tweet, bluesky_poster): Posts a tweet to Bluesky, handling any errors and updating the timestamp upon success.
main(): Loads environment variables, configures components, loads tweets, filters, posts, and saves progress.
Error Handling
Errors during the posting process are caught and printed. If an error occurs with a specific tweet, it is skipped, and the script continues to the next one.
